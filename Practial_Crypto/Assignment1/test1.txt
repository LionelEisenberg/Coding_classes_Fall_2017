The young man was jumping from branch to branch eating up the miles with his slender legs, he was breathing heavily and was sweating profusely as the nefarious creatures lurking in the shadows were growing closer and closer. Aide was running sluggishly when he stopped strait in his tracks, digging his feet in the ground as he prepared a Tharushak Fighting pose. In front of him, on the opposing tree's branch he saw his opponent, a demon danced around the branches like a graceful cat not making a sound, its claws protruded from its paws and they dug into the wood, its body was positioned in a threatening yet vigilant way and Aide knew it could attack at any moment. Aide himself stayed calm even though he was breathing deeply, he took a defensive pose and he held up a guard, ready to fight. Suddenly, the demons eyes narrowed and it growled as it pounced on its pray, Aide knew the demon was going to attack but he was surprised by its speed and accuracy, to dodge the attack he had to roll back, before he could get back on his feet, the demon leapt on him again thrashing its powerful claws at him. Aide put his foot between himself and the demon and kicked it as hard as he could as he let out a loud roar. The demon was sent across the clearing, but it landed on its feet and there was no sign of any damage on its rock-like skin as its wound healed instantly. Again it prepared himself to attack but this time it was more cautious studying the human in front of him. Aide quickly got back to his feet before the demon could plunge its razor sharp claws in its skin. But again the demon was too fast leaping at Aide, it slashed its claws at Aide's arm breaking his guard, he took a step back, but before he could get his guard back up the demon plunged its claws in Aide's abdomen.

Aide howled in pain as blood gushed out of his wound and he fell to the ground clutching his belly, from where the blinding pain was emanating. The demon readied itself to deliver its killing blow, bounding on his prey, but before it could do so it was hit in the snout by the butt of a warded axe. The demon was sent across the clearing, sprawling on the hard earth of the forest's floor. It got up quickly snarling at the man who towered like a giant over it, Sam was more than 7 0feet tall a humongous beast of a man, and he had an enormous warded steel axe swung over his shoulder, he had a well formed upper body as any Sunner had and scars streaked his face and arms showing his experience in demon fighting. He stared at the demon observing it, it was a rock demon and a young one at that inexperienced in battle. Sam and took a pose inviting it to attack, the demon filled with anger took the opportunity to leap on Sam it tried to slash at him but his new opponent swung his heavy axe at the demon. It struck home and sparks flied as the axe hit the demon in the rib cage sending it sprawling on the oak trees' roots, this time the wound, painted in black foul ichor, did not heal instantly. The injured demon did make the same mistake twice and instead of attacking the giant in front of it, it rapidly passed him and went to finish off its first prey, but as he approached Aide, he saw a woman on her knees tending to the wounds of the injured fighter. Dianna was rather small and was very fit, she had the slender curves of a woman and the strong muscles of a warrior, she was applying bandages to Aide's wound to block the flow of blood and making him chew a black herb from her herb pouch to dull his pain. The demon smirked thinking she would be another easy prey, but Dianna was no easy prey, she had been fighting demons for a while now and she had the scars to prove it, she knew every trick in the book when it came to demon fighting and she waited for the last moment, acting as though she had not seen the demon coming to take out her warded bone knife. The demon was startled by the action and Dianna took advantage of the demons' surprise to plunge her long knife in the demons heart. It let out a deafening screech that made every animal in the forest shiver as blood flowed profusely from his chest and it fell to the ground. Dead. Sam crouched on Dianna's side “he's gonna make it?” He asked in an emotionless tone pointing at Aide, “guess so, but we need to bring him back to Will back in the pasture fast or he aint gonna be able to walk for a while.” She answered in a similar way, no distress or anxiety shook her voice, Sam gently picked up the wounded youngster and said in an exasperated tone “let’s get goin’ then…” And they ran off into the night.

They had been running for hours when the walls of the Sunny Pasture came into view and the first rays of sunlight were shining on the battlefield in front of the great gate of the pasture and already the many demon corpses were starting to effervesce and burn away. Dianna and Sam arrived at the gate, they were panting heavily and their lungs and thighs were burning. Dianna signalled at the tired guard on top of the little tower, he yawned and rubbed his eyes as he opened the gate. Even though it was dawn, the Pasture was bustling with energy, the wounded were being carried to the hospital, the smiths were repairing the damaged spears and building some new arrows for the following night and the herb gatherers were rushing to the battlefield to succour injured warriors. Dianna's face was red when she screamed “Will! Will! I’ve got an injured Hunter!” As soon as she was done shouting, a slender man came running down towards Dianna. Will was well into his fifties but he looked like a forty year Vagor, he had black short hair With a little grey here and there, he too had a long scar that raced from his eye to his collarbone but he was much less muscular then his nephew Sam and was a little taller than Dianna. He inspected Aide quickly and said to Sam as he sighed deeply “bring him to my office”. They followed Will to a big wood building, He opened the heavy oaken door to reveal a simple room with a straw cot in the middle next to a burning hearth, and there was a small table near the cot where a pouch of herbs and tools were laid flat. Sam grunted as he dropped Aide on the cot, and Will tore his brown robes off, Aide was very muscular for his age he was not more than sixteen and like any boy that age in the Pasture, he had been trained to have very firm muscles and a very well formed body. Will took off the soaked bandages that were placed on his abdomen, he scanned his wound quickly and immediately he knew what to do, he crushed some red herbs and mixed them into a bowl of cold water immediately turning the clear liquid into a Ichor like mauve solution. He then poured the potion on the wound and the black traces signalling demon infection disappeared in an instant. He then hovered his hands over the poor boy's wound. Suddenly the lines on Will's hand flared to light and illuminated the room with a bright flashing light. Aide's breathing grew much lighter, however beads of sweat started rolling on Will's face and he started panting, Dianna gasped when the wound completely sealed itself when Will took his hands off and he sat on the floor. She had seen the amazing spectacle of Will's healing magic tending to young soldiers before but every time it amazed her still, but she had to look away to help Will who was nearly gasping for air. Magic was an amazing thing, it managed to kill, heal, and make people’s lives easier, but it was amazingly costly, physically speaking and it took and enormous toll on its users.

As Aide was now much less pale and was breathing normally, Dianna and Sam him on Will's Straw cot and left the wooden building. She waved goodbye to Sam before going to sit on one of the steps of the great square in the middle of the town she breathed deeply trying to calm her body from the strain of the fortnight's battles but she was still shaking with energy and magic was still flowing through her body. She watched in wonder at the energetic town was swiftly recovering from the damage it had taken the past night. More than a 100 warriors were desperately trying to fix the broken walls, to repair the damaged wards that were streaked on the brick walls of the Pasture or even to run out of the city to look for lost arrows. She was happy that she didn't have to chore like this every morning. There were three types of warriors that were trained from a very small age in Sunny Pasture, the first type, the most common type were the Guards. Guards were normal warriors they stood on the wall at night often shooting arrows or short spears to kill the many demons desperately trying to hack at the warded gate. They never fought in close range battle and they guarded the wall until the sun was well over the horizon. During the day they would help the city recover from the damage it had taken and most of them, trained in warding would fix the damaged wards. The second type were the Fighters; every night Fighters were on the battlefield they were the ones who killed the most demons, it was very dangerous to be a fighter and most of them would retire after mere years. During the day Fighters were exempted from duties and would make love to their wives, relax and prepare for the next night's battle most of them had wards etched and tattooed in their skin and that took an enormous toll on them. The last type were Hunters, there were very few Hunters in Sunny Pasture, compared to Fighters and Guards, Hunters had a completely different training and a only the best and most agile children in Shisarak were chosen to become hunters. During the night Hunters would leave the safety of the Pasture's wards and they would hunt down the strong demons that were smart enough not approach the village. They would then harvest their kills flesh in order to feed the warriors of the village for in order to be stronger when they fought the warriors would feast on the magically charged demon flesh that was only found on the strongest of demons. A Hunter trainee would sharpen his skills until he reached the age of 16 in Thurak, the Hunters training camp. Boys, at the age of 10 would be chosen to start and train in any of the three camps: Thurak was the Hunters camp, Wall was the Guard camp and Jiyuk was the Fighter camp. Girls however were only allowed access to the training grounds at the age of 12 and their training was much tougher than the boys'. At the age of 16 a hunter trainee would leave the Pasture for the first time, and with the company of his two mentors, the trainee's skills were put to test against demons. That night had been Aide's test and evidently, he had failed since he could not hold up against a real demon. Dianna sighed, she knew Aide would have to suffer another year of relentless training if he did not excel in tonight’s hunt. It was unfair really, Aide had been an excellent student he was the first in his class and he could use any Tharushak pose as well as any Hunter in the Pasture, but he had cracked under the pressure for nothing in the mortal world could compare to the feeling of looking a demon straight in the eyes.
Aide had been trained in Tharushak at both Shisarak and Thurak and he knew the ins and outs of the Sunny Pasture fighting style like any veteran of the village. The Tharushak was the Pasture’s fighting system against Demons, it used a range of weapons as well as hand to hand combat.

The sun was falling over the horizon and Aide woke up he felt as if he had been run over by a horse, his whole body was aching, his legs and arms were extremely sore and there was a dull pain emanating from where his wound used to be. It had been replaced by a bright white scar, and he knew that that was Will’s doing. He reached around for his robe, and pulled it over himself, he grabbed his belongings and rushed out of the room walking in a forceful manner as every step sent tremors of dull pain up his spine. He arrived in the middle of the square and already it was dusk and the ground was starting to sizzle and effervesce. He met up with the other hunters most of which were much more experienced and old than him. He spotted Dianna and Sam in the middle of the small crowd.
“Hey buddy, how are ya feelling?” Sam asked him even though Aide could see he was not genuinely concerned.
-“I’m fine my body is aching from head to toe though…” Aide answered as he rubbed his shoulder
-“here this is a little salve Will made for you it should make you feel better” Dianna said as she handed him a pink flask filled with an opaque solution.
-“thanks that should help, I hope it—“he was cut off by Sam who interjected
-“are you sure you want to go out again tonight? You can always try again next year, you are not in your best shape and you might get wounded again…”
Aide looked at him in the eyes and sighed: “I’m sure, and don’t worry, I won’t mess it up…” he slid past the giant and went to pick up his weapon of choice from the armoury. He slipped in his fine leather body armour picked up a light warded sword and a satchel of throwing daggers along with a heart piercer: a dagger designed for the gruesome task of putting an end to the life of a demon. A hunter trainee would choose any weapon amidst the most basic, when he graduated, he would be able to forge a weapon of his choice that would be his and that he or she would use every night. Sam had his axe, Dianna her knife and Aide had fantasized every night as to what weapon he would choose. Aide was lost in his thoughts as Dianna cried out “C’mon Aide let’s go!”
Dianna looked at him as they arrived at the gate of the city and told him “I was just as nervous as you for my Graduation test, don’t worry and if you’re anxious just close you’re eyes and breathe deeply” He did as she said and joined his two mentors as they set off in the night.

The three of them had been running for almost 3 hours and the woods were now pitch black. Sam had a ward lantern at the end of his axe which lighted their way. They were running in a single file for speed, mobility and safety. At the head was Sam lighting the way, in the middle Aide and at the rear was Dianna. She was holding a glass sphere, a Seeker. These were glass globes with wards etched on it that gave of a mystical yet faint blue light. A Seeker was one of the Hunters toolkits; it was used to track down the strongest most magically charged demons. Every hunter Team was compose of three Sunners, one was a healer and tracker, one was usually an enforcer the stronger, muscular one and one was an assassin. Dianna made a barely audible squeak and motioned to stop, the orb she was holding in her hand was pulsating towards the south. She looked at Sam who nodded and took the lead heading full speed into the dark woods to the south, Dianna followed and Aide who was a little confused about what was happening did so too. After half an hour of sprinting through the woods, Aide’s face was all red, he was breathing heavily and his arms and legs were scraped by the abundant thorns of the forest. Sam and Dianna did not seem so phased by the intense sprint. Aide was about to ask what was happening when Dianna brought her slender fingers to his mouth, she then pointed to a clearing that was barely visible through the branches in the middle of it stood an earth demon gleaming in the moonlight.

The demon was absolutely massive about twice as big as the one Aide had fought the previous night. The lion-like creature lay there in the middle of the faint moonlight its skin, scales as hard as rock, glistening. The orb Dianna was holding was beginning to heat up as it pulsated it more rapidly towards the demon, she whispered a few words on its surface and in a second it became as black as the night itself. Aide knew Dianna could perform some sorts of magic since she was a tracker but did not apprehend to what extent her proficiency in magic was developed. Dianna and Sam looked at their trainee and Dianna made a few hand symbols. Aide then recalled the conversation they had earlier as they were running through the woods.
“Aide” said Sam as the three companions were running through the night “if we run in to any demon this is how its gonna go down, first I will grab its attention and try to get in a few punches in then Dianna will attack it trying to take it down and when it comes after her that’s when you give the final blow, got it?”
Aide nodded to Dianna and Sam making them understand that he knew what to do, and he saw them dash to the other sides of the clearing in order to trap the fiend and deny it any escape route. Aide started getting closer and closer to the demon without it noticing and he got ready holding his warded sword in one hand and three throwing knives in the other, his heart piercer not far away. Aide heard a sharp whistling sound familiar to the chant of a Nightsong a slender black bird, the emblem of Sunny Pasture and he knew that was the signal. Aide readied himself knowing this was his shot at graduating, and that he could not falter, any mistake could mean having to repeat another year of hellish training or worse, death. Aide felt butterflies in his stomach, he started to sweat profusely, he was breathing faster and faster, his vision began to blur and he was screaming over and over in his head “I can’t do this, I can’t do this I have to go I am no Sunner just a boy,” and just as he was about to bolt in the opposite direction he recalled Dianna’s earlier words and took a deep breath. As he closed his eyes again the shaking and sweating had stopped as if an enormous pressure was lifted from his chest. When he opened his eyes he saw an enormous man running out of the thick berry bushes about 25 feet away from him swinging his oversized axe in their enemy’s direction.

Sam was bellowing a war cry and swinging his axe over his head as the muscular man was darting at the demon with remarkable speed. In a blink of an eye the demon was on its feet and studying his opponent he backed up slowly towards Dianna’s hiding spot. Their enemy seemed much more cunning, experienced and strong than the creature who had punctured Aide’s front 24 hours ago. Aide studied the demon with a near awe like look, it looked impressive almost majestic and his gaze made every hair on Aide’s back to stand up on end. Waves of magical energy were radiating through the air and Aide who had never learned any form of magic could still feel the charged atmosphere. After 30 seconds or so the demon got on its hindquarters and got ready to assault his prey. Scars traced the demon’s pale skin and it was obvious that if he hooked his fangs on Sam, it would not be the first human flesh it had ever tasted. Aide had the feeling that the demon was not oblivious to Dianna’s and his presence nor could he sense them.

Suddenly the demon attacked. Unlike its smaller cousin his onslaught seemed more calculated, careful, planned: instead of leaping on Sam he dashed in an exuberantly speedy fashion, zigzagging across the 50 feet that separated it and Sam. As soon as he was in range of Sam’s axe he kept his whole body inches off the ground, using Sam’s height against him. From underneath him, the demon leaped digging its claws into Sam’s chest who was taken off guard by its opponent’s velocity. Luckily, the demon’s claws, long and sharp as knives were met by the hard steel cuirass of Sam’s full body armour and he managed to throw his elbow into the demons upper chest. It was sent flying but the beast swivelled in the air and in a heartbeat was throwing himself at Sam again. The rock demon was a few steps away of Sam who was still dizzy from the creatures first assault and Aide was pondering the decision to step in and grab the demons attention, but as he was about to do so he heard the strong, piercing cry of Dianna as she leaped out of one of the tall trees, her bone dagger held in her two hands over her head. The demon stopped straight in his tracks and just as Dianna’s dagger approached his belly, he jumped in the air and swivelled on the side. Dianna did not pierce her target but she grazed its side as it dodged her attack and a jet of black blood sprayed over the clearing. The demon emitted a sharp yet deep howl like scream but to Aide’s marvel his wound stitched itself up in seconds. It then stared at Dianna and studied her movements, after a few seconds it leapt on Dianna jumping 15 feet in the air. Sam was still woozy and Dianna was on her own, she parried the first two attacks the demon made but it managed to knock her knife out of her hand and push her against the back of the clearing, she was defenceless an easy prey for the now hungry creature. It approached the woman in front of it and it sprung off its back legs flying like a bullet canon towards a defenceless Dianna.

In mid-air the creature was struck by three knives, all three punctured the demon in the side sending sparks in air followed by a thick stream of black foul smelling blood. Aide rushed at the demon shouting his sword held in his two hands next to his belly. Dianna let a sigh of relief as she saw Aide come out of the bushes and ran to go fetch its knife. The demon was caught off guard and did not expect Aide’s next attack to be so quick and powerful: Aides sword punctured the lower left side of the monsters front and again it howled in pain. Aide felt a gush of energy coursing through his veins and he went to finish the massive beast off and end its foul existence. He lifted his sword high in the air and as he was about to sever the fiend’s head of his body, the Demon leapt away from its attacker and just as it was about to jump on Aide again there was a loud audible crack and the demon was dead.

Sam’s axe protruded from the demon’s broken neck and all three hunters were exhausted. Dianna got up and went to cauterize and cleanse the scratches that covered Aide, she knelt down and whispered as she smiled “see? You did great” she winked at him and went to cleanse the claw marks that marked Sam’s stomach. As she was healing his minor wounds she said coyly “the runt kept his promise didn’t he? “ Sam grunted and nodded his head looking away, as if he was ashamed. Aide was still on his knees his short sword stuck in the ground his throwing knives laid around him on the floor, he was staring at his hands in half horror, half wonder. He could feel the demons magic pulsate through his veins like a flow of energy, he had this sensation that he had never had before, as if he could do anything at will. He felt powerful. Dianna looked at him and immediately understood, “feelin‘ funny?” she asked. Aide stopped staring at his arms and hands tainted black in filthy demon blood, he looked up and said with a worried yet exhilarated tone “it’s as if my blood had been replaced with some sort of ethereal energy. I feel strong yet fast, powerful yet accurate, as if I had become another person”, Dianna smirked realizing that Aide had never had that feeling before, she approached him and knelt down “that feeling you’re having that is because of demon magic, you took some its power when you plunged you sword in his skin, that magic is what makes them powerful, what makes them stronger than any animal their size” she put her hands over Aide’s closing his fingers as if to make a fist and she covered her hands with hers. Aide saw a shimmering blue light orbit around their hands, he looked at her in the eyes and realized Dianna’s complexion. She was no more than 20 years old and had pale white skin, her silky yellow hair flowed down on her shoulders and accentuated her honey yellow eyes. As Aide was lost in her eyes, Dianna smiled and said “that’s why harvest demons organs, to give that feeling to the warriors on the battlefield every night”, Dianna got to her feet and walked slowly away to help Sam reap the massive demons organs. Once they were done all three brushed the blood and dust off their clothing and started walking back to the village.

When they arrived at Sunny Pasture, the Sun was already high over the horizon as they had been tired from their fight and could no longer run at top speed through the night. Aide arrived at the gate and could barely stand he was wheezing and the rush he had gotten from the defeat of the monster had now completely disappeared. They came in through the great gate and Sam put his hand on Aide’s shoulder and told him in his manly strong voice “congratulations… runt…” Aide still panting looked at him and smiled. As he turned around Dianna gave him a quick hand motion asking him to follow her, he did so and he brought her to the middle square of the Thurak where Aide had spent his last 6 years. There, the masters of Thurak who had trained him were there waiting for him on the opposite side of them was the leader of the Sunny Pasture Hunter Squad: Seneca. Dianna told Aide to go see his masters as she went to sit by the old hunter’s side. The four masters in front of me were staring and their gaze passed through me chilling me to the bone. The youngest of the masters whose hair was still specked with white traces pulled a dirty parchment from his satchel, he rolled it out and said in a loud strong voice:
“The culmination of your training, young one comes down to this day, tirelessly, you have been educated in both Shasirak and Thurak. Young one today is the day when you join the ranks of men and answer the call for the battle against the demon kind. Today we the masters of Thurak release you of your oath in order for you to sware the oath of the Hunter.” He made Aide kneel as he marked his fore head in a thick liquid that he later understood was demon blood. His heart was pumping worrisomely fast in his chest, he turned away to see Seneca gazing at him quizzically from the other side of the square. In what seemed like a lifetime, Aide crossed the marble square, each stop echoing in the daylight and marking as step towards his future. He arrived in front of his future mentor and master and he was met with an investigating gaze. Seneca was watching this new hunter, inspecting every aspect of him from his red blushed face to his skinny fingers, he opened his mouth and Aide was expecting another speech from the man in front of him but all he did was get up put his arm around Aide as he said “Don’t mess this up, runt”. He then accompanied Aide to a small fountain in the middle of the square that had escaped Aide’s eye when had first looked around at the square. He looked at it contents in was filled with a little pool of foul ichor with at its centre a still beating heart. Aide turned towards Seneca who looked at him and nodded as he said “go ahead”. Aide looked down at the block of demon flesh pulsating black liquid out of its holes, he gulped down, swallowed his fear and bit into the heart.

Everything went black and the last thing Aide could remember was his head bouncing off the marble floor as he inhaled the last bit of flesh. He woke up in his bed, he looked on his bedside table and his brown robes of a trainee had been replaced by the night black robes of hunter. A smile touched his lips and he sighed, a sigh of relief and happiness. He got to his feet and felt something similar to what he had felt the night before after defeating that rock demon. He felt powerful. Aide raced down the stars and ran to the hunter assemble camp called Honrak. He was greeted by a stale atmosphere filled with the scent of ale and smoked grass. He stumbled his way through the camp as his eyes were stinging and followed the directions Dianna had left on his night table. He arrived in a large stone building. He was taken by surprise by the overbearing heat of the room in which he was, he quickly realized he was in the Furnace, the blacksmith of Honrak, where all the weapons were made. He asked around if anyone had seen Dianna, a strong middle aged man told me she was in one of the side chambers as he was beating on the hot anvils. He followed his direction and Dianna was sitting on a chair around a round stone table working with some paperwork. As Aide entered the room she looked up saw him and smiled, but she was a mess. Her hair was dishevelled, she had rings under her eyes, her lips were pale and the black blood marks on her forearm meant she hadn’t showered since last night. She may be a mess but she is still beautiful as all hell… Aide thought to himself. “You feelin’ better? Sit! I wanted to speak to you and give you a little… graduation present” she said as she gestured the chair in front of him. He sat down thanking her, on the table, amidst all the paperwork was an unknown arc like object covered in a blank sheet. Dianna gestured to the sheet and told Aide to see what was under it. She could not stop grinning and Aide felt like something suspicious was happening. He lifted the sheet and his heart leapt into his throat, he saw the weapon he had dreamed about since they started training in Thurak, the weapon of a hunter, his Sydra.

The weapon was gold and incrusted with tiny diamonds Aide later understood were magic pixels stones that concentrate magic. The blade was two sided it was arched the handle in the middle had finger holes. The blade was extremely sharp and like a teeth like a sharks. A string crossed the inside of the weapon that if extended turned Aides sword in a powerful bow. He slid his fingers in the holes and activated the only button on the right side of the sword. The golden metal thread that lined the weapons edge unstrung and turned the edged sword into a powerful accurate bow. Aide’s eyes gleamed in wonder, surprise and euphoria. The weapon was so sharp in could cut air, so quick it could strike faster than lightning and so strong in could endure any blow in Aide’s eyes. He slid his thumb along the handle of the weapon coated with a thick material that was rough as leather but strong as blue marble. The sword compressed itself in a compact grey hexagonal ring that bounded his finger. Some wards were carved in the outer layer of the rings, they were invisible to the naked eye but they lit up when Aide rolled the ring around his finger with his thumb and as the ring transformed back into the glorious weapon. Aide wanted to jump on Dianna and her hug her with all her might, but instead he held back the tears of bliss and managed to mumble a chocked thank you before taking his new gift and turning around. Before he crossed the threshold into the steamy boiling room of the armoury he swivelled his head and told Dianna “Get some rest, you seem to be dead tired”, she looked at him with cold dead eyes and said in a rough voice “hunters are, more often than not like this, but I guess you will discover that soon enough won’t you… now go, leave me.” Aide smiled a weary smile, he was exited yet frightened about what was yet to come. He raced through the streets of the Pasture arrived home, said a quick word to his parents about his graduation and went to bed. For the first night in nearly 14 years, Aide slept a deep worriless slumber wrapped around his new present.
