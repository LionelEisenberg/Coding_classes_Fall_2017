FILES: DIRECTORY AND FUNCTIONALITY:

vigenere-encrypt.go: encrypts a plainText using a specific key with the vigenere
                     cypher. The encryption will strip all non-alphabetic chars
                     from plaintext and will capitalize it.
        to build: go build vigenere-encrypt.go
        to run: ./vigenere-encrypt <KEY> <plainTextFileName>

vigenere-decrypt.go: decrypts a ciphertext using a specific key with the vigenere
                     cypher. The encryption will strip all non-alphabetic chars
                     from cipherText and will capitalize it.
        to build: go build vigenere-decrypt.go
        to run: ./vigenere-encrypt <KEY> <cipherTextFileName>

vigenere-keylength.go: makes a reasonable guess at the keylength of a cipherText
                       We use the Index Of Coincidence technique, research taken
                       from: http://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/NSF-4/Tutorial/VIG/Vig-IOC.html
        to build: go build vigenere-keylength.go
        to run: ./vigenere-encrypt <cipherTextFileName>

vigenere-keylength.go: makes a reasonable guess at the keylength of a cipherText
                       We use the Index Of Coincidence technique, research taken
                       from: http://pages.mtu.edu/~shene/NSF-4/Tutorial/VIG/Vig-IOC.html
        to build: go build vigenere-keylength.go
        to run: ./vigenere-keylength <cipherTextFileName>

vigenere-cryptanalyze.go: makes a reasonable guess at the key (or keys) used to
                       encrypt the given cipherText. I used frequency analysis
                       and the chiSquared method
        to build: go build vigenere-cryptanalyze.go
        to run: ./vigenere-cryptanalyze <cipherTextFileName> <KEYLENGTH>

EXTRA NOTES:

Part 4:1

This vigenere cipher will be more secure if used with a key that is as long as
the message as it will make it impossible for an adversary to commit a
frequency analysis attack on the cipher. Indeed what this would do
is essentially turn the vigenere cipher into a one-time pad. As we have seen in
class the one-time pad is essentially uncrackable (except for brute force)
as for each cipher-plaintext combination there is an equiprobable key (if the
key is chosen at random). The limitations I would impose on the key would be to
be chosen at random and of course to not make it too short, otherwise a
brute force approach might be possible. The limitations with such a technique is
that the key will be unreasonably long and make the whole process very hard.
